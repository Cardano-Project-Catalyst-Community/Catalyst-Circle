(To make using Markdown easy I have created example templates of markdown formatting for links and lists below, simply copy and paste for use)

- How will we manage the onboarding for new circle CCV4
  + All of the circle members will need support and help with onboarding
  + Administrative overhead - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/420109
  + No CC Admin for Circle, Requirement for Administrative support is there
  + Scheduling meeting times
  + Payment to previous members for onboarding and mentoring - his should be left up to the new CCv4 to decide on (y/n/howmuch)
  + Tooling and costs for tools
  + Set up a Roundtable multisig for bounties (remaining rapid funding) 5 members for multisig (current circle)
  + Handover to a new multisig when the time comes (new CCv4 team)
- Bounties for Community works
  + We voted to put all of the Rapid Funding together to go towards any bounties the next iteration of CCv4 may need to assist them with their work.
- DripDropz election
  + Test run
  + Demo video of voting process

Whilst it is preferrable to report directly into github with markdown as shown above, it maybe easier to record meeting minutes into a doc or text file and then copy relevant information over post-meeting
