- Retrospective On Catalyst Circle V4 Candidate Meeting
    1. Candidate meeting coordinated by DripDropz facillitated by Bullish Dumpling
        + The call went really well, 60-70% of candidates turned up to discuss their position and what they saw (+ve & -ve) in Catalyst
        + Everyone present had a chance to talk and we had a huge community turnout with almost 100 people showing up on short notice to participate in the conversation and ask questions.
        + DripDropz team members have withdrawn themselves from the running as not to seem like they may be gaming the system
        + 
    2. We have decided to run another or two in the next week to help get more people on and encourage candidates to show up at a more convenient local time
- Organise an FAQ for DripDropz to help make their job easier
    + What information can we provide in a clear and simple way to help explain the voting places
    + This will be the main focus of the meeting today
    + Who, What, Where, Why, How
- What is the updated timeline and how can we help spread the message
    + We need to confirm DripDropz timeline (get an update from the team) so we can share accurate information
- Emurgo Academy call
    + Here is [the video Quasar mentioned](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx62JvJ5Jg3utASI_sGTBFpn2TQKXBHMC9)
- What will we do about the 15 people?
    + Are we just voting in 5 and allowing people to pick their own team?
    + Are we taking the top people from voting and passing down the next 10 to fill the supporting roles?
