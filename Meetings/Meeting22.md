(To make using Markdown easy I have created example templates of markdown formatting for links and lists below, simply copy and paste for use)

- Nested List Template
    1. Numbered
    2. And
    3. Nested
        + Further Sub Lists
        + Can Be included
        + As necessary
    4. and then continue if needed
- Or return to the parent list

Whilst it is preferrable to report directly into github with markdown as shown above, it maybe easier to record meeting minutes into a doc or text file and then copy relevant information over post-meeting
