# Catalyst-Circle-Reporting

This repo is for Circle representatives to report on their work on a weekly basis

You can upload a text file or copy/paste text from another eitor if you would like. Alternatively we would recommend copying out template below and using that to create an appropriately formatted markdown file to have an easily readable report for your weekly actions.

Works carried out by Circle representatives should include appropriate links to evidence of their efforts where appropriate (please see the table below for examples)
