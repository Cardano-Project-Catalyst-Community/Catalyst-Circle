# Catalyst Circle - CODE OF CONDUCT

The Code of Conduct applies equally to all members of the Catalyst Circle team. The purpose of this Code of Conduct is to explain what behavior is expected of Circle members, to set and maintain ethical standards and to demonstrate integrity on behalf of Circle members and the Catalyst community.

This Code of Conduct should have a way to report incidents or to appeal reports of incidents, and a means for equitable resolution.

Once a Code of Conduct has been agreed, we need a simple process for community members to raise an issue if a Circle member breaches it.
